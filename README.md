## Creation Process

### **1. Strategy**

- I required an easy-to-read, dependable website that delivers clear information about menu options and opening times.
- Location of the clinic must be visible and social media links available.
- clean and simple design and use of graphics and colour to motivate the user.
- Pricing within the pricelist page is to be transparent and simple.
- Mobile responsiveness is an essential feature required for this website.

### **2. Scope**

A large portion of their clients are young women age 20 to 40 who are looking for the best treatments and they want to prevent of any kind of damage and wrinkle to their skin, and they want to spend an hour calmly in a quite place, feeling relax.

- The site is to contain only essential information, presented in a similar fashion and layout.
- Text must be clear and legible on any sized device to allow the user instant access to the menu, location, and opening times.
-
- For future development, the testimonials page has focused on before and after the treatment so clients can introduce lunaria to their friends.

### **3. Structural**

- Easy to identify, clickable links with a consistent layout. The design was to be predictable for each page with the information clearly identifiable.
- A large, clear button to bring the user directly to the menu would be placed front and center of their eye-line.
- In addition, a navigation bar and footer would be visible,where navigation bar sticked at the top of the page when you scrooled down in every page, at every device size, displaying the same information. This would provide the returning customer with a faster route to their information destination.

### **4. Skeleton**

-The site was developed to be simple, clear, and relax.

- An underline feature identifying the current page and also a hover on the menu.
- A large, clear image dominates the landing page with a close-up view of a woman feeling fresh and fabolouse.
- right side of the image, clickable button situated on the image which takes you to the contact page and testimonials page. First-time visitors have access to the menu with one easy click.

- The page ends with the footer, where the social media has placed.

- For the contact us page, the navigation and footer remain as before. big size of eucalyptus leaf behine the form is intoducing the freshnes of the clinic to the client.

### **5. Surface**

-
- A design was created that allowed a consistent flow throughout the four-page site.

- A palette of gray and green was created, similar to the interior of the parlour.
- A clean, playfair, was used in a medium weight to provide legible text at any size.
- back to top buttons has settled in all the pages to make it easy for the visitors when the y scroll down.

### **Typography**

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the fonts 'playfair' and 'Lato'. I felt the clear, soft lettering suited the intended aesthetic of the website. I had intentions to use Lato for my smaller bodies of text, however, I chose to stick with playfair to keep the font consistent.

### **Imagery**

The images that I have chosen for my site reflect the hair and beauty. I used the google editor to crop and edit the images to fit the page. I have used a variety of images to create a variety of pages.

1. Acer Aspire 3 Laptop (1920 X 1080)

2. iPad Pro 2021

3. iPhone SE(2016)

4. Huawei p30 Lite

5. iPhone 11/13

6. Samsung Galaxy s10

### **Testing**

Testing took place throughout the entire build using Dev Tools on Chrome and on the above real-world devices. The browsers used were:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari
